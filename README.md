**So this is my first github repo**

1. It contains an c++ hashing function
2. A bash file to automate adding, commiting and pushing
3. A README.md file based on the simplistic markdown language

*Hey!, chill out and have some H~2~O*

Lets see some code!!

`#include<iostream>
using namespace std
int main(){
cout<<"This is a mardown file!!"<<endl;
}`
