**So this is my first github repo**

1. It contains an c++ hashing function
2. A bash file to automate adding, commiting and pushing
3. A README.md file based on the simplistic markdown language

*Hey!, chill out and have some H<sub>2</sub>O*  

*some italics for you*

`using namespace std`  
`int main(){`  
`cout<<"This is a mardown file!!"<<endl;`  
`}`
